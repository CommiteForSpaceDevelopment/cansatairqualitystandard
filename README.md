Project Proposition: CanSat Air Quality Monitoring System

1. Introduction:

Our project aims to develop an innovative CanSat Air Quality Monitoring System leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze air quality data collected from CanSat launches. By harnessing the power of cloud computing, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS), we will facilitate model training, evaluation, and deployment, while also providing a user-friendly web application for data submission.

2. Objectives:

    Develop a CanSat-based air quality monitoring system capable of collecting and analyzing atmospheric data during launches.
   
    Implement standardized protocols for data collection, scaling, processing, and storage to ensure consistency and interoperability across different CanSat launches. The working name for the protocol is "CSPD Air Quality Data Standard 01."
   
    Define a minimal set of required parameters for data collection, including atmospheric pressure, temperature, altitude, and a single reading for air quality from a sensor like MQ135.
   
    Allow teams the flexibility to incorporate additional data points beyond the minimal required set, such as readings for pollutants like carbon monoxide, alcohol, radiation levels, etc.
    Ensure compatibility with the machine learning model by handling null values gracefully for optional data points.
   
    Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict air quality parameters based on standardized CanSat data.
    Implement a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
   
    Create a user-friendly web application to enable teams to submit their CanSat data for analysis.

4. Methodology:

    Data Collection and Standardization: Gather atmospheric data from CanSat launches, including parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and pollutant levels. Standardization of data is ongoing, with an investigation into the best approach for 
    normalization and feature engineering.
   
    Machine Learning Model Development: Train supervised learning models using standardized CanSat data to predict air quality parameters. Explore various algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to achieve optimal performance.
    Cloud Infrastructure: Leverage AWS for scalable and cost-effective model training, evaluation, and hosting of the web application. Utilize AWS services such as Amazon S3 for data storage, Amazon SageMaker for model training, and Amazon EC2 for hosting the 
   web application.
   
    Web Application Development: Develop a user-friendly web application where teams can submit their CanSat data for analysis. The application will provide a seamless interface for data submission and visualization of air quality predictions.

6. Use Cases:

    Real-time Air Quality Monitoring: Enable real-time monitoring of air quality based on incoming data from CanSat launches, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring agencies and public health authorities.
   
    Anomaly Detection: Identify abnormal patterns in air quality data that could indicate pollution events or environmental hazards, facilitating timely interventions and mitigations.
   
    Forecasting: Predict future air quality conditions based on historical data and meteorological forecasts, supporting informed decision-making for urban planning and public health advisories.

8. Timeline:

    Phase 1: Data Collection and Standardization (Month 1-2): Gather CanSat data and investigate standardization techniques.
    Phase 2: Model Development and Cloud Infrastructure Setup (Month 2-3): Train machine learning models and set up AWS infrastructure.
    Phase 3: Web Application Development (Month 3-4): Develop and deploy the user-friendly web application.
    Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Month 4-6): Test the system's performance and deploy it for real-world use.
